**Total Mockups Identified: 7**

This document provides a detailed analysis of the visual mockups and component structures used in the `About` page.

## 1. Hero Section Tablet Display
**Title:** 3D Tablet Visualization
**Description:** A 3D-transformed tablet device frame situated in the Hero section. It features a realistic bezel, "Dynamic Island" top bar, and a screen area that displays an application screenshot (`/tablet.png`). The device rotates slightly on hover.
**Dimensions:**
- **Device Frame:** 360px (Width) x 520px (Height)
- **Screen Content Area:** Approximately 352px x 512px (Inset by border borders).
- **Aspect Ratio:** ~0.69:1
**Usage Tip:** Use this mockup to display high-fidelity screenshots of the mobile application or dashboard interface. Ensure the source image handles the rounded corners (2.5rem radius) gracefully.

## 2. Liverpool Origin Map
**Title:** Genesis Morphing Graphic
**Description:** A large visual container featuring an abstract map background (SVG paths) and a pulsing dot animation representing a specific location (Liverpool). Includes a glassmorphism quote overlay at the bottom.
**Dimensions:**
- **Desktop (lg):** Height fixed at 600px, width scales with column.
- **Mobile/Tablet:** Aspect function `aspect-square` (1:1 ratio).
- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-[3rem]` (48px).
**Usage Tip:** Use this to visualize geographic origins, headquarters, or server locations. The pulsing animation draws attention to a specific focal point on a map.

## 3. Evolution Timeline Cards
**Title:** Timeline Phase Card
**Description:** Interactive cards positioned along a vertical timeline. They feature an icon badge, title, and rich text description. The cards have a glass-hover effect and glow based on the phase color.
**Dimensions:**

- **Padding:** `p-8` (32px) to `p-10` (40px).
- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-3xl` (24px).
**Usage Tip:** Use for storytelling, step-by-step process flows, or chronological history. Best suited for content with a clear icon + title + description structure.

## 4. Tech Stack Visualization
**Title:** Abstract Intelligence Node
**Description:** A square container featuring floating, animated "tech nodes" interconnected by lines, overlaid on a radial gradient background. Represents the AI/Neural network aspect of the platform.
**Dimensions:**
- **Aspect Ratio:** `aspect-square` (1:1).
- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-[3rem]` (48px).
**Usage Tip:** Use as an abstract representation of complex technology, AI, algorithms, or server infrastructure where a literal screenshot isn't appropriate.

## 5. Impact & Stats Cards
**Title:** Statistics Display Cards
**Description:** Used in both the "Impact by the Numbers" and "Global Movement" sections. Simple, clean layouts focusing on large typography for numbers and icons/labels.
**Dimensions:**
- **Standard Card:** Padding `p-8` (32px).
- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-2xl` to `rounded-3xl`.
**Usage Tip:** Use for social proof, key performance indicators (KPIs), or counting up metrics. Keep text labels short and uppercase for impact.

## 6. Core Pillars Bento Grid
**Title:** Bento Grid Pillar Card
**Description:** A grid of cards displaying core company values. Each card has a colored icon badge and text. They are arranged in a responsive grid (2 columns on md, 3 on lg).
**Dimensions:**
- **Padding:** `p-8` (32px).
- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-[2rem]` (32px).
- **Grid Layout:** Flexible height based on content.
**Usage Tip:** Use for highlighting feature lists, core values, or distinct benefits. The "Bento" style allows for a clean, organized presentation of multiple items.

## 7. Team Member Portrait
**Title:** Team Member Card
**Description:** A vertical image card for team members. It includes a grayscale-to-color hover effect and a gradient overlay that reveals expertise and social links.

- **Corner Radius:** `rounded-[3rem]` (48px).
**Usage Tip:** Use strictly for professional headshots or portraits. The specific 4:5 aspect ratio is critical—wider or shorter images will be cropped. Ensure high-resolution images for the scale effect.
